# Contributing

Thanks for contributing.

## Suggested workflow
1. Create a fork and a branch with a clear name.
2. Make changes with descriptive commit messages.
3. Open a PR with a clear problem/solution summary.

## Standards
- Do not include local files like `.env`.
- Do not commit build artifacts (`liferay/build/`, `node_modules/`, etc.).
- Document usage changes in `README.md` when relevant.

## Basic checks
- `make start`
- `make deploy`

## Reporting issues
Include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Relevant logs (`make logs`)
- Docker Desktop version
- OS and version
